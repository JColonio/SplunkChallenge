# SplunkChallenge

Simple project using Java, TestNG, and Rest-Assured. The project utilizes the TestSuite.xml file to run the test. Currently, only one test file was used but this does leave room for more flexibility and ability to organize the test more effectively.

The project is testing the API library, as is, and should be expanded to sending request (via POST) and validating the results (via GET).

## Getting Started

Everyone is welcomed to utilize this project as a starting point. When possible, please reference this repository. This project was used for a coding challenge, however, whether out not I earn the job I will be expanding this project.

To utilize the project, you must use Intellij (free version is sufficient). Remember to enable maven import to ensure all libraries are updated. You can run the tests by executing the TestNG TestSuite.xml file or via Maven compiler > Test.

## Areas To Improve

"Everything can always be improved" for this project better organization and expanding on the tests are needed. The TestBase class contains any shared functions and can be expanded on. The Tests can easily be divided into different classes and expanded on by adding POST requests (to add full test).
